For what? Propaganda. In Russia, they do not talk about the deportation of children. Russians call this process "evacuation", although in reality it is the forced removal of a child. Russian propaganda constantly portrays Ukrainian children in its news. Ukrainians allegedly kill children in Donbas and abuse them. In this case, Russia seems to play the role of the protagonist and protects children.</p>

    <p>What do they do with the children? The occupiers first undress the children and look for Ukrainian tattoos. If found, they are cut off with the skin. Children are taken to orphanage or filtration camps. They are not allowed to contact their relatives, they are beaten, their documents are taken away and guardianship or adoption is established over them.</p>

  <p>Danger: The danger is that a citizen of Russia will be able to be adopted. And the adoptive parents have the right to completely change the information about the child - they can give him a new name, surname and patronymic, change the date and even the place of his birth. The child may not even remember who he is and where he is from. These children are now having a big trauma because of their life situation. </p>

  <p>How to find children? Information about where the child may be is collected in detail - testimonies, monitoring of the Russian mass media, volunteers. Attempts to contact colleagues from Russia have yielded no results.Ukrainian goverment developed a web-site named The Children of the War. It collect the exact numbers of the children who were possibly displaced or deported. Also from all our sources, national sources and open sources, there are information about these children, including names, profiles and photos. It is a portal for requests from persons who are looking for children and know the dates of birth and nationality. They may want to learn if there have been changes in their passports or nationality documents.</p>
